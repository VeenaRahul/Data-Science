**Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project**



1. 🧠 **Oral Cancer Prediction - Data Analysis Project**

📌 **Overview**
This project focuses on data analysis for oral cancer prediction using patient medical and lifestyle data. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that contribute to early detection and understanding of risk factors associated with oral cancer.

🧪 **Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Scipy (for hypothesis testing)
CSV (for data storage and manipulation)

🔍 **Key Steps Performed**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed key variables such as age, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, etc.
Visualized data distributions and correlations.
Risk Factor Identification
Identified features most associated with oral cancer presence.
Used correlation heatmaps and group comparisons.

📊 **Sample Visuals**
Age-wise, Gender-wise, Country-wise cancer risk distribution
Analysis of cancer symptoms
Analysis of survival rate, tumor size, treatment type according to cancer stage

✅ **Outcomes**
Identified lifestyle patterns associated with higher oral cancer risk.
Demonstrated importance of early screening based on key indicators.

📎 **Dataset**
The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaidpy/oral-cancer-dataset .



2. **Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Project**

📌 **Overview**
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on key medical attributes. The aim is to build a reliable model that can assist in early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

🧠 **Objective**
Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on features like age, cholestrol, blood pressure, smoking, alcohl intake, exercise, diabetes, obesity, stress level and chest pain
Evaluate and compare different ML models to find the best-performing one.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
Jupyter Notebook

📊 **Dataset**
Source: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset 
Attributes: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, etc.

🔍 **Key Steps Performed**
Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and outliers.
Scaled/normalized features.
Encoded categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation heatmaps and pairplots to understand relationships.
Visualizations of feature distributions by heart disease status.
Model Training & Evaluation
Trained multiple ML models:
Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

**Model Selection**
Selected the best model based on evaluation metrics.
Performed hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).

📈 **Results**
Best model: Decision Tree with 100% accuracy
Achieved balanced performance across precision and recall.


✅ **Conclusions**
Machine learning can effectively assist in early heart disease detection.
Simple clinical data can lead to impactful insights when analyzed properly.
