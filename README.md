🧠 Oral Cancer Prediction – Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project focuses on data analysis for oral cancer prediction using patient medical and lifestyle data. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that contribute to early detection and understanding of risk factors associated with oral cancer.

🧪 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn (for optional modeling)

CSV / Excel (for data storage and manipulation)

🔍 Key Steps Performed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed key variables such as age, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, etc.

Visualized data distributions and correlations.

Risk Factor Identification

Identified features most associated with oral cancer presence.

Used correlation heatmaps and group comparisons.

(Optional) Predictive Modeling

Basic classification using Logistic Regression or Decision Tree (if applied).

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall.

📊 Sample Visuals
Age-wise cancer risk distribution

Tobacco/alcohol usage vs. cancer diagnosis

Heatmap of feature correlations

✅ Outcomes
Identified lifestyle patterns associated with higher oral cancer risk.

Demonstrated importance of early screening based on key indicators.

🚀 Future Work
Integrate more advanced machine learning models.

Include data from different demographic regions.

Build a dashboard for interactive data exploration.

📎 Dataset
Include source if public. Example:

The dataset was sourced from [XYZ Research Institute] or [Kaggle link if available].
