🧠 Data Analysis of **Oral Cancer Prediction**

📌 **Overview**
This project focuses on data analysis for oral cancer prediction using patient medical and lifestyle data. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that contribute to early detection and understanding of risk factors associated with oral cancer.

🧪 **Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Scipy (for hypothesis testing)
CSV (for data storage and manipulation)

🔍 **Key Steps Performed**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed key variables such as age, tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, etc.
Visualized data distributions and correlations.
Risk Factor Identification
Identified features most associated with oral cancer presence.
Used correlation heatmaps and group comparisons.

📊 **Sample Visuals**
Age-wise, Gender-wise, Country-wise cancer risk distribution
Analysis of cancer symptoms
Analysis of survival rate, tumor size, treatment type according to cancer stage

✅ **Outcomes**
Identified lifestyle patterns associated with higher oral cancer risk.
Demonstrated importance of early screening based on key indicators.
